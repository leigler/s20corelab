### Github
Github is a website that offers hosting for software development *version control* using Git.
\**Translated: Github is a website that allows us to publically store files (kind of like Google Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox). But it is* not *smart or automatic.*

<br>We will be using Github&rsquo;s storage and hosting abilities throughout the course to document and publish our work.

### HTML/CSS
What is HTML (Hypertext markup language)? [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model#/media/File:JKDOM.SVG%5D(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/JKDOM.SVG/2000px-JKDOM.SVG.png))
 
> &ldquo;In 2015, Frank Chimero wrote on the “Grain” of the Web, focusing on a web-native media that doesn’t try to fight the inherently rectangle-based HTML Document Object Model (DOM) [...] This remains true: any site that does not look rectilinear is usually just fooling you; strip the CSS and it’s just a pile of blocks. Perhaps tilted and stretched, or with the corners shaved off, but just a pile of blocks.&rdquo;
<br>—from [Lukas Winkler Prins](https://www.are.na/block/736425)

- HTML is a document in which you arrange and re-arrange boxes
- CSS is a way to style and shape your HTML

### HTML:

HTML elements:
- tags: `div, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, ol, ul, li, span`
- links: `a`
- images `img`
- attributes: `class, id, href, src`

### CSS:
How do we select things to style with?
- `elements` (all of one type)
- `classes` (all of a custom type)
- `ids` (an unique element)

<br>How do we determine size?
- `width`
- `height`
- `margin`
- `border`
- `padding`
- `box-sizing`

<br>How do we decide how (and where) an element is placed?
- `position: relative`
	- `display: block`
	- `display: inline-block`
	- `display: inline`
- `position: absolute`
- `position: fixed`

<br>How do we define how the typography looks?
- `color`
- `font-weight`
- `background-color`
- `font-family`
- `@font-face`
- `line-height`
- `letter-spacing`

### Boilerplate
We can find a boilerplate html + css file [here](/files/boilerplate.zip). 

### In-class Exercise: Truck Typography [TruckLife are.na channel](https://www.are.na/ben-ross-1515211424/trucklife)

New York City is filled with trucks—containers transporting anything from food and tools to money and trash. All trucks need to include some information: 

> &ldquo;The New York City Traffic Rules require that commercial vehicles display the registrant's name and address on both sides of the vehicle.&rdquo; — ([nyc.gov](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/truck-and-commercial-vehicle-faq-05-2019.pdf)). 

It does not, however, say *how* this material should be displayed. This fact, along with an abundance of creativity (and often, a sense of humor) means that almost no two trucks in NYC look alike. 

<br>For this first exercise, you will create two html pages. They must somehow link to one another:
	- Page 1: Embed your selected truck's image within the page
	- Page 2: Select at least one truck's face (either from the are.na channel or a truck you happened to have photographed) and recreate it within the browser. You may use custom illustrations and open-source typefaces to create your truck page.

## Assignments: 

### 1. Exercise Completion:
Please complete your *Truck Typography* exercise and upload it to Github for next week.

### 2. Core Interaction Webring
Additionally, please revisit the simple `index.html` page you made and uploaded to github. This will be your homepage for both *Core Lab* and *Core Studio* for the duration of the semester and will be used to create a *Section I [Webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring)*.

Taking what you&rsquo;ve learned so far, make sure to have the following *four* sections included: 
- Section 1: An introduction to who you are (Name, interests, internet presence (optional))
-	Section 2: A link to all other students' [Github Pages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zs-5NcqBZeeb1_Nd0Zv0Lx9D1G5n_vOaoC8FbEfUzZg/edit?usp=sharing)
- Section 3: Studio: A link to each Core Studio project
- Section 4: Lab: A link to each Core Lab exercise and assignment

<br>The visual style and layout is up to you—take a moment to consider how this page will grow (with new projects added each week), and how you might want to separate each section. If you need inspiration on how to express yourself on the web, I would recommend Laurel Schwulst&rsquo;s essay for The Creative Independent: [My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/).
