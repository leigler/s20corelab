# Javascript Loops

We have already learned how to make code run based off of specific conditions using `if(){ }` statements:

```javascript

var i = 1;

if(i <= 10){
	// run some code!

	console.log("hello!");

}

```

### But what if we want to repeat an action 10 times? 100 times? 1000 times? *n* times?

To repeat a sequence of events in javascript, we need to tell our code *when to stop*. Otherwise our code will run forever. We can use what we&rsquo;ve learned from if statements to do this.

In Javascript we use loops to repeat actions multiple times. There are two main types of loops, *while* and *for*.


### While Loop
### \*Dangerous\*

The while loop runs until the condition inside its `()` isn&rsquo;t met. The example below would run forever (or until your browser crashes):

```javascript

var i = 1;

while(i <= 10){

	console.log("hello!");

}

```

This is because our code doesn&rsquo;t change `i`. `i` will always be less than or equal to (`<=`) 10.

This can be changed by modifying `i` everytime the while loop runs:

```javascript

var i = 1;

while(i <= 10){

	console.log("hello!");
	i = i + 1;
}

```

Now, each iteration will update `i` by one. After 10 iterations, the while loop will stop because `i` will be equal to 11. 

`i = i = 1` is so commonly used in javascript that we have a shorthand:

```javascript

var i = 1;

while(i <= 10){

	console.log("hello!");
	i++; // i++ is the same as i = i + 1;
}

```


## For Loop
A for loop is similarly used to repeat a sequence of actions (insteading of typing those actions out for each and every possible case).

This example also repeats ten times:

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
	var result = i * 6;
	console.log(result);
}

```

If you take a close look inside the `()`, you'll recognize three statements:
- Our starting point: `var i = 1;` defines our variable `i`
- Our ending condition: `i <= 10` is a conditional
- Our iteration: `i++` increases our count by 1;

Together, this can be read as: For the code inside this statement, start with 1, don&rsquo;t stop till we&rsquo;re at 10.

`for` loops are generally considered safer than `while` loops because we are forced to define an end point.

## For Loops and Arrays

### Array length
Arrays are lists of dataâ€”we can learn certain things about them, like their length:

```javascript
var myArray = ["apples", "oranges", "pears", "tomatoes"];

console.log(myArray.length);
```



### Using Arrays
We can use for loops to traverse previously stored information:

```javascript
var myArray = ["apples", "oranges", "pears", "tomatoes"];

for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
	console.log(myArray[i]);
}

```
