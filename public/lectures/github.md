### Github
Github is a website that offers hosting for software development *version control* using Git.
<br>\**Translated: Github is a website that allows us to publically store files (kind of like Google Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox). But it is* not *smart or automatic.*

<br>We will be using Github&rsquo;s storage and hosting abilities throughout the course to document and publish our work.
