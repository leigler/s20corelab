What is HTML (Hypertext markup language)? [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model#/media/File:JKDOM.SVG%5D(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/JKDOM.SVG/2000px-JKDOM.SVG.png))
 
> &ldquo;In 2015, Frank Chimero wrote on the “Grain” of the Web, focusing on a web-native media that doesn’t try to fight the inherently rectangle-based HTML Document Object Model (DOM) [...] This remains true: any site that does not look rectilinear is usually just fooling you; strip the CSS and it’s just a pile of blocks. Perhaps tilted and stretched, or with the corners shaved off, but just a pile of blocks.&rdquo;
