# Assignment: Programming Plants

For next week, create a small plant out of html and css. Using the `setInterval` function we reviewed last class to program the plant to slowly change overtime. 

Utilizing responsive units like `%`, `vw`, `vh`, make this plant responsive: not only to browser width but also to browser height.

## Considerations 
- What kind of plant are you making? is it real or fictional? If it&rsquo;s real, what defining characteristics does it have?
- What perspective does the viewer have of the plant? (do we see it from the top or side?)
- How quickly does the plant change?
- What variables can you save and re-use?
- From what direction does the plant change?
- How might you use the CSS `transition` property to animate your plant&rsquo;s changes?
- How might you use conditionals to account for what happens to the html page once the plant is bigger than the screen?
