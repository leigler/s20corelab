# Exercise: Truck Typography
- [TruckLife are.na channel](https://www.are.na/ben-ross-1515211424/trucklife)

New York City is filled with trucks—containers transporting anything from food and tools to money and trash. All trucks need to include some information: 

> &ldquo;The New York City Traffic Rules require that commercial vehicles display the registrant's name and address on both sides of the vehicle.&rdquo; — ([nyc.gov](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/truck-and-commercial-vehicle-faq-05-2019.pdf)). 

It does not, however, say *how* this material should be displayed. This fact, along with an abundance of creativity (and often, a sense of humor) means that almost no two trucks in NYC look alike. 

<br>For this first exercise, you will create two html pages. They must somehow link to one another:
	- Page 1: Embed your selected truck's image within the page
	- Page 2: Select at least one truck's face (either from the are.na channel or a truck you happened to have photographed) and recreate it within the browser. You may use custom illustrations and open-source typefaces to create your truck page.
