# Exercise: With Feeling

This is an exercise in movement and branding as much as it is an exercise in exploring how to use Javascript libraries.

For next week (March 6), please create an animated digital poster inviting friends and family to a small-scale private event (20 people max) in a public space. This could be a birthday, a performance, a graduation party, a day-trip, a dinner party, or a long walk. The important thing is that this event is tied to at least one specific location.

Once you have selected your event&rsquo;s location and purpose, consider what kind of movement might be pulled from your event&rsquo;s characteristics. 
- Is the location cold? 
- Is the location busy? 
- Is the event happy? mournful? 
- Are you celebrating an individual or a group?
- Is the event soon? in the distant future?

How might you communicate these characteristics through motion and visual metaphor? Your poster should include at least two animated elements—these animations should communicate something concrete about both the location and the event&rsquo;s mood.


### Your poster should include the following information: 
- Event Name
- Location
- Time
- A call to action/description
- RSVP Information

### Technical Requirements:
- Your website should be fully responsive
- Your website should have some sort of continuous animation using [GSAP](https://greensock.com/)
- Your website&rsquo;s animation should somehow communicate both the feeling of the space and the event&rsquo;s mood through visual metaphor (how might you animate a poster for New Years? Your birthday?)
