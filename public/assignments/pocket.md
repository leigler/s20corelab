# Assignment: Pocket Composition

For this assignment, you will be exploring the responsive potential of websites using CSS `media queries`. You will create a modular composition with at least 3 breakpoints:

### A few requirements: 
- Your composition will be composed of 4-6 unique modules*
- Your entire composition needs to be at least twice the height of the browser (i.e. you should be able to scroll), but not all modules need to scroll
- Each module can be rotated/transformed to create more variance
- Each breakpoint will yield a change in color and layout (as well as any other change you see fit)
- Not all modules need to be present for every breakpoint

When building this assignment, consider how you might effectively use (and *re-use*) `classes` to group different modules, how you can allow different media queries to override one-another, and how change in color and scale might dramatically change the composition as a whole. 


<br>\**Each module will be a `div` with child `divs`, most likely utilizing the css `overflow: hidden;` property*

### Context: 

As a primary reference for this assignment, please examine Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s drawing *All combinations of arcs from corners and sides; straight, not-straight, and broken lines*. Instructions and images of the drawing can be found in [this]((/files/sol_lewitt_moma-1978-excerpt.pdf) excerpt of Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s 1978 book by MoMA. 

<br>Below is a description of Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s wall drawings articulating their responsive nature:

> A site becomes available, not necessarily one that the artist has seen in advance. After consideration of the dimensions and physical properties of the walls, LeWitt stipulates a certain kind of mark,and a certain form of distribution of marks by a sketch and/or verbal or written account. The instructions also serve as the work's description after it has been done, so that the wall is bracketed verbally, both beforeand after execution. The process-record is abbreviated, compressed between identical accounts of conception and completion
