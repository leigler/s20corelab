# Assignment: Pocket Composition

For this assignment, you will be exploring the responsive potential of websites using CSS `media queries`. You will create a modular composition with at least 3 breakpoints\*:

### A few requirements: 
- Your composition will be composed of 4-6 unique modules**
- Your entire composition needs to be at least twice the height of the browser (i.e. you should be able to scroll), but not all modules need to scroll (some parts of your composition can be `fixed`)
- Each module can be rotated/transformed to create more variance within your composition
- Each breakpoint will yield at least change in color and layout (as well as any other change you see fit)
- Not all modules need to be present for every breakpoint

When building this assignment, consider how you might effectively use (and *re-use*) `classes` to group different modules, how you can allow different media queries to override one-another, and how change in color and scale might dramatically change the composition as a whole.

### A few considerations:
- What css attributes work in ways you didn&rsquo;t expect? Can you capitalize on their output?
- How might each pattern module relate to its surrounding modules?
- Your pattern needs to be able to scroll, what optical effects might this produce?

<br>\**A breakpoint is the &rsquo;point&lsquo; at which a media query sets into effect*
<br>\*\**Each module will be a `div` with child `divs`, most likely utilizing the css `overflow: hidden;` property*

### Context: 

As a primary reference for this assignment, please examine Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s drawing *All combinations of arcs from corners and sides; straight, not-straight, and broken lines*. Instructions and images of the drawing can be found in [this](/files/sol_lewitt_moma-1978-excerpt.pdf) excerpt of Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s 1978 book by MoMA. 

<br>Below is a description of Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s wall drawings articulating their responsive nature:

> A site becomes available, not necessarily one that the artist has seen in advance. After consideration of the dimensions and physical properties of the walls, LeWitt stipulates a certain kind of mark,and a certain form of distribution of marks by a sketch and/or verbal or written account. The instructions also serve as the work's description after it has been done, so that the wall is bracketed verbally, both beforeand after execution. The process-record is abbreviated, compressed between identical accounts of conception and completion
