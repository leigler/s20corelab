# Core Interaction Webring
## Due January 31
Please revisit the simple `index.html` page you made and uploaded to github. This will be your homepage for both *Core Lab* and *Core Studio* for the duration of the semester and will be used to create a *Section I [Webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring)*.

Taking what you&rsquo;ve learned so far regarding HTML elements, nesting, and the utilization of `classes`, `ids`, and css styles, make sure to have the following *four* sections included:
- Section 1: An introduction to who you are (Name, interests, internet presence (optional))
-	Section 2: A list of links to each of your fellow students&rsquo; Github pages from this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zs-5NcqBZeeb1_Nd0Zv0Lx9D1G5n_vOaoC8FbEfUzZg/edit?usp=sharing).
- Section 3: Studio: This section is for your Studio class and should link to each Core Studio project (for now, you&rsquo;ll just have a link to your Cards project)
- Section 4: Lab: This section will contain links to all your Core Lab exercises and assignments.

The visual style and layout is up to youâ€”take a moment to consider how this page will grow (with new projects added each week), how you might want to separate each section, and how it distinguishes itself from other websites. If you need inspiration on how to express yourself on the web, I would recommend Laurel Schwulst&rsquo;s essay for The Creative Independent: [My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/).

Please have your page uploaded to your github repository by next class.
